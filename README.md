This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Ada related to array assignment.  When you assign one array to another in Ada, it doesn't create a deep copy.  Instead, it creates an alias unless the data types are constrained. If the source array is subsequently modified, the changes might be reflected in the destination array, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to create a true copy to avoid this problem.
